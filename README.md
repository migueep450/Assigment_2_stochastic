# Assigment of stochastic processes for sequence analysis  
  
We have to study the genome from the Dengue and Zika viruses.  
  
## Exercise 1.  
  
For solve it we use the Hidden Markon Chain Model.  
  
## Exercise 2, 3 and 4  
  
We try to find the relation between some parameters which have each sequence.  
We use the regression techniques to find it.
